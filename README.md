# Visual-Crytography

A new type of cryptographic scheme, which can decode concealed images without any cryptographic computations. The scheme is perfectly secure and very easy to implement. We extend it into a visual variant of the k out of n secret shazing problem, in which a dealer provides a transparency to each one of the n users; any k of them ca~ see the image by stacking their trazasparencies, but any k - 1 of them gain no information about it.
